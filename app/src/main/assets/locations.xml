        <location_descr>This is situated on the roundabout at the intersection of the Heerengracht and Walter 	Sisulu Avenue
	(Fig. 2). The participants will leave the CTICC at the eastern entrance and care must be taken in
	crossing the road to the roundabout. The statue was a gift from the Portuguese government to South
	Africa on the occasion of the tercentenary celebrations of the landing of Jan van Riebeeck, but was
	only unveiled in 1960 near the South African National Gallery and moved to the present site in about
	1984 [15]. The statue is bronze and about 2.5 metres high, the sculptor being Professor Barata 		Feyo
	[15]. It rests on a pedestal and a flat plinth of very light grey, coarse-grained, porphyritic granite of
	the Cape Granite Suite. The pedestal was designed by the architect, Fernandes de Sá. The stone 		has a
	sawn finish and contains lath-like orthoclase phenocrysts, up to 80 mm long. Grey to dark grey
	xenoliths, a few of which have been partially assimilated by the granite, are also noticeable and
	attain 100 mm in length. The porphyritic granite was possibly obtained from Mamre Quarry, near
	Atlantis, since local quarries in the region of Kloof Nek, including the Higgo Quarry (Fig. 1), had
	already been closed for a considerable period by the time that this memorial was built.
	We cross the road on the southern side of the roundabout and briefly stop at a plaque
	commemorating Bartolomeu Dias, which is mounted on a pedestal and base of the medium-grained
	“Paarl Grey” granite, more extensive examples of which will be seen later on the tour. We proceed
	southwest along the “island” between the two roads of the Heerengracht (Fig. 2) and pass numerous
	blocks of sandstone with a sawn flat top for persons to sit. The sandstone is fine-grained, beige in
	colour and cross-bedded in places. It is known commercially as “Golden Dawn” and is quarried from
	Mookgopong (formerly Naboomspruit) in Limpopo Province. It is fluvial in origin and is from the Early
	Jurassic Clarens Formation, Karoo Supergroup [16]. At the southern end of the “island”, we cross 		the
	exit road to Hertzog Boulevard and arrive at the War Memorial (Fig. 2).</location_descr>
